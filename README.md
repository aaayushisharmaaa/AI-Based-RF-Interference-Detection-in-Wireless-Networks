# AI-Based-RF-Interference-Detection-in-Wireless-Networks
This project is focused on detecting network interference using key metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Packet Loss, and Latency. The model leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to analyze time-series data and predict potential interference. Upon detecting interference, a recommendation system can automatically suggest switching to a less congested channel, optimizing network performance.

Introduction
Interference in wireless networks can degrade performance and lead to packet loss, high latency, and low bandwidth efficiency. This project aims to build a model that:
-> Detects interference based on key metrics.
-> Classify Types of Interference
-> Optimize Detection Accuracy Using AI

Dataset
The dataset should include time-series metrics related to network quality, including:

SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
Packet Loss
Latency
Bandwidth Usage
